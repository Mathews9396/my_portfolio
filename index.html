          Hi, I'm Dan MacKinley!

        </h1>
        <p>
          I am a Software Engineer with 4.5 years of experience specializing in
          backend development using JavaScript (Node.js). I have worked on both
          relation and non-relational databases, managed code using version
          control systems such as Github and Gtilab. I have proven my ability to
          enhance system efficiency (e.g., improving data retrieval by 50% and
          execution speed by 75% for a real time whiteboard application).
          Passionate about writing clean, and reusable code to create meaningful
          software solutions.
